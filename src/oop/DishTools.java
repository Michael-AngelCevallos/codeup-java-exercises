//-- SHORT ASSIGNMENT #2 --

//Create a class of static members (variables and methods) called DishTools
//  - todo AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS - an integer constant set to 1300
//  - todo shoutDishName() - that takes in a Dish object and prints out the name in all caps
//  - todo analyzeDishCost() - that takes in a Dish object and will print out either “More expensive than average” or “Less expensive than average”, depending on the value of the dish costInCents compared to AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS
//  - todo flipRecommendation() - that takes in a Dish object and reverses the wouldRecommend boolean value
//  - todo Try out the DishTools methods with Dish objects in the DishTest main method

//BONUS - add some static methods to the Dish class that compares two dishes in some way
